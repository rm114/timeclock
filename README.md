# Kronos Timeclock Assistant

This project was created to be an addition to the timekeeping application Kronos. This script gives the output of how much time the user has to work in the week, and what time they need to log out on the last day to prevent overtime. All the user needs to do is input how many hours they have worked so far for this pay period, (optionally) provide the last time they clocked in/out, and select the maximum allowed hours for the current work week. The script will output a pretty table with all of the relevant information for the user.
