# Timeclock

This project was created to be an addition to my current timekeeping application. My current timekeeper does not tell you how much time is left in your work week to reach the maximum hours, nor does it tell you when you need to clock out to avoid going over the maximum hours. This script fixes both of these issues, all the user needs to do is input how many hours they have worked so far for this pay period, (optionally) provide the last time they clocked in/out, and select the maximum allowed hours for the current work week. The script will output a pretty table with all of the relevant information for the user.
